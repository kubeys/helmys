Helm + YS - Support YAMLScript in Helm Templates


## Synopsis

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kubeys/helmys
$ make -C helmys install PREFIX=~/.local
$ helmys init <chart>
$ helm install <name> <chart> --post-renderer=helmys
```


## Description

The `helmys` (pronounced "helm wise") command provides a way to use YAMLScript
for Helm templating.
You can use as much or as little [YAMLScript](https://yamlscript.org) in your
Helm templates as you wish, replacing all the Go templating syntax or none of
it.

Using YAMLScript for your templating needs is much cleaner than the standard Go
templating.
See this gist for a comparison of a full conversion:

https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/c0afc0071133c696c5b4f17b5ee86b98

In addition templates that use YAMLScript exclusively for YAML are valid YAML
files, thus various YAML tools like `yamllint` can be used on them.


## Setting It Up

Setting up HelmYS is very simple.
Just install `helmys` and `ys` (the YAMLScript CLI binary), then initialize
your chart.

### Installing `helmys` and `ys`

In this directory, run:
```
make install PREFIX=~/.local`
```

This will install `helmys` in `$PREFIX/bin/`.
It will also install the YAMLScript binary `ys` in `$PREFIX/bin` if it is not
already there.

> **Note**: You can use any directory absolute path for `PREFIX` as long as it
> contains a `bin/` directory that is in your PATH.
> Also `ys` must be version `0.1.84` or higher.


## Initializing your chart

Run:
```
helmys init <chart>
```

This will install 2 files in your chart's template directory that are required
by `helmys`.

* `helmys.yaml`
  This template gets data for the `Release` template variable.
* `helpers.ys`
  This is a YAMLScript port of the default `_helpers.tpl` Go template file.
  It is used to define reusable variables and functions for use by the
  YAMLScript in your templates.
  This `helpers.ys` file supports everything for the templates generated by
  `helm create`.
  You are encouraged to add your own functions and variables to it.


## Using `helmys` with `helm install`

Just add the `--post-renderer=helmys` option to your `helm install` commands.
```
$ helm install <name> <chart> --post-renderer=helmys
```

At the moment things work best when you run `helm install` from the chart's
directory.
See `HELMYS_CHART` below for other options if that is not possible.
Some forms of `helm install` might not be possible, but that should be fixed
soon.


## Environment Variables

HelmYS has some environment variables that you might want to use.

These 3 are for logging the YAML states during `helmys` post rendering.

* `HELMYS_INPUT=<file-name>`
  Name of a file to write the text that `helmys` read (from `helm`) on stdin.
* `HELMYS_THRUPUT=<file-name>`
  Name of a file to write the text after `helmys` altered it to add a few
  required by YAMLScript.
* `HELMYS_THRUPUT=<file-name>`
  Name of a file to write the text after `helmys` altered it to add a few
  required by YAMLScript.

The `helmys` command needs to know the directory on disk of where the chart
being installed lives, and `helm` doesn't provide that at the moment.
Hopefully this will be fixed soon.

If `helmys` can't infer it it will error and ask you to set
`HELMYS_CHART=<chart-path>`.


## Try It Out

You can run `make test` which just runs the `test.sh` Bash script.
It creates a new Helm chart, adds the `helmys` stuff and runs `helm install`
on it, printing all the commands as it goes.


## Status

This is very new stuff.

At the moment, it's a PoC to show that YAMLScript can be used with Helm 3.
Expects bugs, fixes and changes.

Please let us know what's wrong with it, and how it can be made better.
